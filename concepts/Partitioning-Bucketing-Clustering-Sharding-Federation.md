# Partitioning, Bucketing, Clustering, Sharding, Federation

These concepts are key to scaling large datasets and optimizing query performance across distributed systems. While often used interchangeably, they serve **different purposes** and apply to different parts of the data stack.

## 🔹 Partitioning

### 🔍 What It Is

Splitting a large table or dataset into smaller **chunks (partitions)** based on column values.

### ✅ Benefits

* Enables partition pruning for faster queries
* Reduces scan size

### 📌 Example

Partition user activity by `event_date`, so queries only scan data for `WHERE event_date = '2025-06-14'`

### 🛠 Tools That Use It

* Hive, Spark, BigQuery, Snowflake, ClickHouse

---

## 🔸 Bucketing

### 🔍 What It Is

Dividing data within partitions into **fixed hash-based buckets**, usually for **joins and sampling**.

### ✅ Benefits

* Faster joins by co-locating keys
* Predictable data distribution

### 📌 Example

Bucket user data by `user_id` into 100 buckets

### 🛠 Tools That Use It

* Apache Hive, Presto, Spark (less common in cloud-native warehouses)

---

## 🔸 Clustering (a.k.a. Z-Ordering)

### 🔍 What It Is

Physically **sorting data within partitions** based on frequently filtered columns.

### ✅ Benefits

* Improves query performance on range filters
* Reduces IO on sorted columns

### 📌 Example

Cluster a `transactions` table by `country_code` or `user_id`

### 🛠 Tools That Use It

* BigQuery Clustering
* Delta Lake (Z-ordering)
* Snowflake Clustering Keys

---

## 🧩 Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning)

### 🔍 What It Is

Breaking a database table into **smaller chunks (shards)** that are distributed across **different machines**.

### ✅ Benefits

* Enables horizontal scaling
* Reduces single-node load

### 📌 Example

User data: users A-M on Shard 1, N-Z on Shard 2

### ⚠️ Tradeoffs

* Requires routing logic
* Cross-shard joins are expensive

### 🛠 Tools That Use It

* MongoDB, Cassandra, CockroachDB, custom sharded Postgres setups

---

## 🌐 Federation

### 🔍 What It Is

Ability to **query multiple heterogeneous data sources** as if they were one.

### ✅ Benefits

* Single interface over multiple systems
* No need to replicate data

### 📌 Example

Querying data from PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and S3 in a single SQL interface

### 🛠 Tools That Enable It

* Presto/Trino
* BigQuery external tables
* Starburst
* Snowflake External Tables
