# Batch vs Streaming Processing

Understanding the difference between **batch** and **streaming** processing is foundational in data engineering. Both are essential but solve different types of problems depending on latency, data volume, and business requirements.

## 📦 Batch Processing

### 🔍 What It Is

Batch processing involves **collecting a large volume of data** over time and processing it at once.

### ✅ Characteristics

* High throughput
* Latency is measured in minutes or hours
* Jobs are often scheduled periodically (e.g., daily, hourly)
* Easier to debug and test

### 📌 Use Cases

* Daily report generation
* Data warehouse ETL jobs
* Machine learning model training

### 🛠 Common Tools

* Apache Airflow
* Apache Spark (Batch mode)
* AWS Glue
* Google Cloud Dataflow (Batch mode)

## 🔁 Streaming Processing

### 🔍 What It Is

Streaming processing deals with **real-time ingestion and processing** of data as it arrives.

### ✅ Characteristics

* Low latency (milliseconds to seconds)
* Data is processed record-by-record or micro-batch
* Requires handling late or out-of-order data
* Needs robust fault tolerance (checkpointing, retries)

### 📌 Use Cases

* Fraud detection
* Real-time dashboards
* Sensor or IoT data analysis

### 🛠 Common Tools

* Apache Kafka
* Apache Flink
* Apache Spark Structured Streaming
* Google Cloud Pub/Sub + Dataflow

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs

### Batch Pros

* Simple to design and operate
* Mature ecosystem of tools
* Ideal for large-scale processing and transformations

### Batch Cons

* High latency; not suitable for real-time insights

### Streaming Pros

* Enables real-time use cases
* Can process continuously without delay

### Streaming Cons

* More complex to develop and debug
* Requires robust monitoring and error handling

## 🧠 Design Decision Guidance

Choose **batch processing** when:

* Data can tolerate latency
* Workload is periodic and volume is high

Choose **streaming processing** when:

* Data must be processed in real time
* Use cases include alerts, real-time metrics, or transactions
