# Bronze / Silver / Gold Layering (Medallion Architecture)

The Bronze-Silver-Gold data architecture — also known as the **Medallion Architecture** — is a widely adopted pattern for **organizing data processing layers** in modern data lakes and lakehouses.

It promotes **clarity, modularity, and reliability** across ETL pipelines.

## 🪙 Layer Overview

| Layer  | Purpose                   | Data Type           | Typical Actions                        |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Bronze | Raw data ingestion        | Semi/unstructured   | Ingest, parse, preserve original shape |
| Silver | Cleaned and joined data   | Structured, typed   | Deduplicate, filter, join              |
| Gold   | Business-ready aggregates | Aggregated/modelled | Aggregate, derive KPIs, optimize       |

## 🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

### 🔍 Purpose

* Store **raw ingested data** as-is for traceability and reproducibility.
* Supports replaying pipelines from the original source.

### 🛠 Examples

* JSON logs from APIs
* Kafka topic ingestions
* CSVs from vendors

### ✅ Best Practices

* Preserve metadata (e.g., source, ingestion time)
* Version files or batch IDs
* Append-only, immutable

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer (Cleansed Data)

### 🔍 Purpose

* Clean, normalize, and **standardize data**.
* Perform **joins**, **type conversions**, **filtering**, **deduplication**.

### 🛠 Examples

* Join users with country codes
* Clean text fields, map enums
* Add surrogate keys and audit columns

### ✅ Best Practices

* Idempotent transformations
* Include change detection logic (updated\_at)
* Track data quality issues (nulls, anomalies)

---

## 🥇 Gold Layer (Business Logic & Aggregations)

### 🔍 Purpose

* Provide data in a **BI/analytics-ready format**.
* Pre-compute common KPIs and aggregations.

### 🛠 Examples

* Daily active users by region
* Revenue by campaign and channel
* Cohort analysis tables

### ✅ Best Practices

* Partition by business-relevant keys (e.g., `event_date`)
* Store pre-aggregated metrics for dashboard speed
* Validate against known benchmarks

## 🔁 Pipeline Flow

```
RAW (Bronze) → Cleaned/Enriched (Silver) → Aggregated/Curated (Gold)
```

* Each layer feeds into the next
* Layer separation ensures traceability and debuggability

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Skipping Silver: jumping straight from raw to gold adds tech debt
* Mixing logic across layers: keep transformations modular
* Ignoring metadata: you’ll regret it when debugging

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Add audit logs per layer (row counts, quality checks)
* Implement tests for schema and row validity at Silver layer
* Gold layer should be versioned or snapshot-based for rollback
