# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a design pattern in which services or components communicate by producing and consuming events. It's especially useful in decoupled, scalable systems — making it a core concept in modern data engineering and microservices.

## ⚙️ What Is an Event?

An **event** is a record of something that happened. It typically contains:

* A **timestamp**
* A **type** or **name** (e.g., `user_signed_up`, `payment_processed`)
* **Payload/data** relevant to the event

Example:

```json
{
  "event": "order_placed",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-14T09:00:00Z",
  "user_id": "123",
  "order_id": "A456",
  "amount": 299.99
}
```

## 🏛️ Key Components

### 1. **Event Producers**

Systems that **generate events**. E.g., web apps, services, IoT devices.

### 2. **Event Brokers / Message Queues**

Middleware that **routes and stores events**, enabling decoupling.

* Kafka
* RabbitMQ
* Amazon Kinesis
* Google Pub/Sub

### 3. **Event Consumers**

Systems or jobs that **react to events**, either in real-time (stream processors) or via batch jobs.

## 🔁 Common Patterns

### ➤ Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

* One producer, many consumers
* Decoupled consumption logic

### ➤ Event Streaming

* Events are logged and consumed in order
* Kafka is widely used here

### ➤ Event Sourcing

* Application state is built from the log of events
* Useful in systems that require full audit trail or reprocessing

## 🧠 Benefits of EDA

* Loose coupling → better scalability & flexibility
* Real-time responsiveness
* Simplified failure handling and retries (with brokers)
* Enables microservices to evolve independently

## ⚠️ Challenges & Tradeoffs

| Challenge                 | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Debugging & Monitoring    | Harder due to async flow                      |
| Event Ordering            | May require partitioning strategies           |
| Data Duplication / Replay | Consumers must handle idempotency             |
| Schema Evolution          | Producers and consumers must agree on formats |

## 🏗️ Where It’s Used in Data Engineering

* Ingestion pipelines using Kafka or Pub/Sub
* Trigger-based data pipelines (e.g., S3 upload triggers ETL)
* Real-time anomaly detection
* Building change data capture (CDC) systems

---

## 🚀 Example Use Case

### "User Signup Analytics Pipeline"

1. User signs up → Event `user_signed_up` sent to Kafka
2. Kafka triggers a Flink job that enriches the user
3. Result is stored in ClickHouse and updates the dashboard in seconds

## ✅ When to Use EDA

Use event-driven architecture when:

* You need near real-time processing
* Systems must be decoupled and scalable
* New services may be added in future without refactoring others

Avoid if:

* Simpler batch processing is enough
* Strict transactionality is more important than responsiveness
