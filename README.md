# Data Engineering System Design

Welcome to the **Data Engineering System Design** repository — a curated collection of design patterns, architecture diagrams, tradeoffs, and case studies aimed at preparing for **FAANG-level data engineer interviews**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository is tailored to:

* Understand **how data engineering system design differs** from typical backend system design.
* Prepare for **system design interviews** at companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Apple.
* Build reusable mental models for real-world data architecture.
